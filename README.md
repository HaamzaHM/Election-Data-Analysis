# Election-Data-Analysis
<h1>Election Data Project - Polls and Donors</h1>
<h4>In this Data Project we will be looking at data from the 2012 election in the USA.</h4>
In this project we will analyze two datasets. The first data set will be the results of political polls. We will analyze this aggregated poll data and answer some questions:
Who was being polled and what was their party affiliation?
<ol>
<li>Did the poll results favor Romney or Obama?</li>
<li>How do undecided voters effect the poll?</li>
<li>Can we account for the undecided voters?</li>
<li>How did voter sentiment change over time?</li>
<li>Can we see an effect in the polls from the debates?</li></ol>


<h2>Donations Analysis</h2>
<h4>Let's go ahead and switch gears and take a look at a data set consisting of information on donations to the federal campaign.</h41>
This is going to be the biggest data set we've looked at so far. You can download it here, then make sure to save it to the same folder your iPython Notebooks are in.

The questions we will be trying to answer while looking at this Data Set is:

<li>How much was donated and what was the average donation?</li>
<li>How did the donations differ between candidates?</li>
<li>How did the donations differ between Democrats and Republicans?</li>
<li>What were the demographics of the donors?</li>
<li>Is there a pattern to donation amounts?</li>
